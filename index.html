                    <h3>Glaciers 3 ways</h3>
                    <p> By boat: a ferry glides you across Swiftcurrent Lake, then it’s a five minute walk for a skip across Lake Josephine on a different ferry. It’s an ideal intro to Glacier’s ice-shaped world: Swiftcurrent and Josephine are glacier-made paternoster lakes, so called because they’re like two rosary beads.</p>

                    <p>By trail: Grinnell stands out as the most impressive and easiest to see among the park’s shrinking roster of glaciers. After ferrying across the lakes, follow the 3.6 mile trail to Grinnell Glacier Viewpoint. Heads up: this is the heart of grizzly country, so join a ranger-led hike or go in a group.</p>

                    <p>By road: props to the workers who spent 23 years blasting, tunneling through, and dangling off cliffs to build Going to the Sun Road, a 50 mile park drive that climbs up the Rockies to the Continental Divide, then climbs down the other side. Most spectacular drive in America? Oh yeah. Challenge: pay attention to the road and not to scenery. There are lots of turnouts – stop at all of them.</p>

                    <h3>Geysers 3 ways</h3>
                    <p>Punctual: pay homage to the world’s most famous geyser, Old Faithful, still performing between every 64 and 94 minutes. From there, stroll the rest of Upper Geyser Basin for spectacles like Beehive and Fan.</p>

                    <p>Trippy: drive to Midway Geyser Basin to see Grand Prismatic Spring, a psychedelically colored hot spring and a good name for an indie rock band. After that, hit nearby Lower Geyser Basin for Great Fountain Geyser and Fountain Paint Pot.</p>

                    <p>Geeky: explore the park with instructors who can make concepts like hydrothermal alteration entertaining. You’ll learn firsthand the difference between a hot spring and a fumarole. </p>

                    <h2>Bryce and Zion</h2>
                    <p>Slot Canyon: There are canyons big and small in Zion and Bryce, but none more beloved than the slot canyon. You’ll know one when you see it – these slits formed by rushing water are deeper than they are wide. Exploring one might mean turning sideways and sucking in your gut. Access a bunch on Zion’s River-side Walk as it leads up the North Fork. You’ll be boulder hopping until you hit The Narrows, a stretch where 1,000 foot cliffs enclose a gap just 20 feet across. It’s a challenge so avoid during rainstorms.</p>

                    <p>Mesa: This is the flat part of a steep geological formation, sort of like a roof. In Zion, the valley may be a riot of sheer red cliffs, but the mesas reveal a world of cream colored domes and forever views. And there’s non eerier or more breathtaking than Checkerboard Mesa, near the park’s east entrance. The cone shaped formation – actually an ancient hardened sand dune – is covered in horizontal furrows and vertical fractures that give it a crosshatched look and make it fun to scramble up.</p>

                    <p> Arch: Start with sandstone, add rain, and wait 50,000 years… presto, it’s the perfect arch. At 287 feet across, Zion’s Kolob arch is the second longest freestanding natural arch in the world. Only problem? Getting to it requires a brutal 14 mile trek. A more manageable 5 mile up and back on Taylor Creek Trail delivers Double Arch Alcove, which doubles down on the sandstone magic to reveal two separate bridges being carved, grain by grain, out of a 1,700 foot rock wall.</p>

                    <p>Hoodoo: In Bryce, they take on various forms: a totem pole, giant sea anemone, ET’s head. According to Paiute legend, the spirelike formations came from the remains of an ancient people who were turned to stone after angering gods. Geologists explain the phenomenon as a pattern of alternating hard rock and soft rock. Stroll along the Navajo Loop Trail to witness a dreamscape of magic: spooky, surreal, and like nothing you’ve ever seen before.</p>

                    <h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
                    <h3>Five ways to get your grand on</h3>
                    <p>Pick a rim: the North and South Rims are only 10 miles apart as the crow flies – but you’re no crow. By road, you’re looking at a 4-hour drive, without traffic. So you’ll need to choose. The good news: they’re both life-alteringly awesome, the South Rim for its culture (museums, architecture), the North for its extensive trail network.</p>

                    <p>Don’t be a Griswold: you didn’t come this far to snap a few pictures, stamp your park passport, and disappear. Get below the rum. The Bright Angel Trail gives you a taste of the canyon’s scale and steepness (it’s a 1,000 foot climb back to the rim). And farther down, Indian Garden is a no joke hike – 9 miles round trip with a 3,000 foot climb – but perfect for anyone looking to experience the canyon from inside up.</p>

                    <p>Meet Mary Colter: the architect designed sic structures in the park, using local stone and timber. Each one blends into the epic setting, from the Pueblo-inspired Hopi House to the rustic Hermit’s Rest. View resembles a 1,000 year old Native American structure, while Lookout Studio appears carved straight out of the Kaibab lime stone cliffs on which it sits.</p>

                    <p>Love a lodge: first timers grouse that the dining room at the 1905 El Tovar Lodge doesn’t have much of a canyon view. But park pros know it’s all about the interior, with vaulted pine ceilings and Native American murals by Hopi artist Bruce Timeche. It’s where the same bow tie-clad waiters have been serving the same creamy polenta corncakes and salmon tostadas for a decade.</p>

                    <p>Watch it all go down: many a sunset money shot has been snapped from the terrace of the North Rim’s Grand Canyon Lodge. The Ad-irondack chairs aren’t especially comfy, but kick your feet up on the stone wall and take in the view – Grand Canyon’s finest – and you’ll have no complaints. And the show doesn’t end when the sun goes down: the terrace’s big fireplace flames brightly and the canyon begins to glow with the moonlight.</p>
